Core UI is a  collection of MVC based classes and interfaces written in ActionScript 3.0 for developing applications.

The framework provides a basic set of view componenets and controllers that are designed for creating cutting edge rich application for the web and tablets, the framework where designed using a metaphor similar to iOS devices and some syntax are also borrowed from UIKit as the don't exists elsewhere. but the prefix is just for extra mark that they belong to the Core UI framework.

As perfection is my middle name, performance and clean design where a important factor in the development of this framework.
